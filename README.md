Below you will find links to the various educational and personal/freelance projects I've completed on my Tableau public account.

### World Demographics Animation
Visualizing World demographics across Fertility rate, Life expectancy, population, region, and country across time (1960 - 2013). Created to illustrate that the divide between "developed countries" as low birth rate and high life expectancy and "developing countries" as the opposite may have been true 50 years ago, but the divide is not so clear today...

### Coal Terminal Maintenance Analysis
An analysis of idle capacity for various reclaimers and stacker/reclaimers in a fictional coal terminal. Goal was to identify any unit that sat at greater than 10% idle capacity (moving less than 90% of nominal capacity) over an 8 hour moving average. Additional analytics performed to see trends of idle capacity for each machine to predict potential maintenance needs on machines prior to the next check in.
